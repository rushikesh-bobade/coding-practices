# Unique Paths II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the  **top-left corner**  (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the  **bottom-right corner**  (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include  **any**  square that is an obstacle.

Return  *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == obstacleGrid.length
- n == obstacleGrid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;

        int[] dp = new int[n];

        // Starting cell
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Obstacle blocks all paths
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dp[j] = 0;
                } 
                // Add paths from the left cell
                else if (j > 0) {
                    dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```
