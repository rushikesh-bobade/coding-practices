# Find the Safest Path in a Grid

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`, where `(r, c)` represents:

- A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
- An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0

You are initially positioned at cell `(0, 0)`. In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

The  **safeness factor**  of a path on the grid is defined as the  **minimum**  manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.

Return  *the  **maximum safeness factor**  of all paths leading to cell* `(n - 1, n - 1)` *.* 

An  **adjacent**  cell of cell `(r, c)`, is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)` and `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.

The  **Manhattan distance**  between two cells `(a, b)` and `(x, y)` is equal to `|a - x| + |b - y|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of val.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= grid.length == n <= 400
- grid[i].length == n
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
- There is at least one thief in the grid.
